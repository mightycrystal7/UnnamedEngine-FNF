*On this Example, i will be adding a new difficulty called "Crazy", all charts for this difficulty should end with "-crazy".*

ðŸ”¥ **PART 1 - Adding the difficulty to the list** ðŸ”¥

This is probably the easiest part.
Our difficulty will be called `Crazy`, and the chart suffix will be `-crazy`

Open CoolUtil.hx inside `source/`, right at the start, you will see this array:

So... add your new difficulty to it, like this.

We're basically done with it, but now comes he boring part.

ðŸ‘½ **PART 2 - Files** ðŸ‘½

You will need the difficulty image for the Story mode menu, and you're also gonna have to do the Crazy difficulty chart to all songs.
Here's my Crazy difficulty image for an example:

Put this image inside `assets/preload/images/menudifficulties/` with it being named `crazy.png` and we're ready to go!
If you've done everything alright, it should be in and working properly!
